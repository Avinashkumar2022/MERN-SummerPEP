server deals with request and response.
Browser makes a request to the server for a resource.
We can use backend to manage the system and to make sure that the frontend works perfectly.
Users don't interact directly with the backend instead they can interact through the frontend.

In MERN JS is the primary language for the use case in backend.

MERN there are three layers:-
    View layer- React

    Application Layer- Node.js and express js

    Database Layer- MongoDB


Node.js is a JS runtime environment that uses chromes V8 engine to execute the code.

Nodejs is single_threaded, so it executes one thread at a time.

Node js has event driven architecture- When you perform an action in node js, it will perform an event.

Nodejs is non blocking in nature.

Node js is asynchronous in nature
